# 1000 primes
Â± a few more

This is little python program to take an input from the user (a number)
and output that number of primes

example:
- input: 10
- output: [1,2,3,5,7,11,13,17,19,23]

### What i learned
- Findings primes isnt actually that hard. It just takes some time and computing power. Even a small program like this running over and over again raised my cpu core tempeture to 70C
